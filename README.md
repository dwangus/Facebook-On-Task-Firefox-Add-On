#Facebook On-Task (Firefox Add-On)

Keeps you on task when you first visit facebook!

Options include:

- Searching for a person/page/group/event/etc.

- Opening up a chatbox based on who you're looking for!

- Using facebook's built-in feature and highlighting the "What's on your mind?" text-area!

- Opening up the birthdays dialog! (if it is indeed a friend's birthday)

- Look at your notifications, messages, or friend requests!

##To Install

Either go to the add-on page and download: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fb-on-task/

Or, you can simply, in the Firefox browser, press "Cmd + O" and select the fb-on-task.xpi file and click "Install Now" in the prompt that pops up.
